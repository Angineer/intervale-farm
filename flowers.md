Maureen raises a wide variety of cut flowers for sale at the farmer's market and the farm stand. CSA members receive a fresh bouquet weekly with their shares. In addition to these sales, we also offer special occasion flowers such as weddings, anniversaries, and any other occasions. Maureen does arrangements but also has flowers available by the bucket for customers who wish to do their own arranging. Please call or email for pricing and availability.
