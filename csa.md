Intervale Farm CSA is a twenty week share program. This is our 24th year . We offer fresh produce, herbs and flowers on a weekly basis. Farm eggs are available at pick up . This season the CSA will be managed by Ben Geary who has worked with Rick and I for several years.

Our CSA Consists weekly on farm pickups, June thru October. We offer two share sizes, Full and Medium.

* Full Share: $600.00 This option consists of 9-13 Items each week. Ideal for a decent family to dine on all week or perhaps a couple/individual who enjoy freezing and canning some of the peak freshness for the winter.
* Medium Share: $450.00 This option consists of 7-10 items each week. A good amount for roommates or couples to share or a veggie enthusiastic individual.

Additionally with every share we’ll continue to offer Maureen's beautiful bouquets, but on a bi-weekly basis, with a bouquet of mixed herbs or a mix of hot peppers or maybe even a pint of neighboring farm's fruit on the off weeks.
