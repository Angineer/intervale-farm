The Northampton Farmer's Market has been running continuouesly for 50 years ! Our farm has been participating for 40 years . The Saturday market has been a steady source of income for our family farm . We greatly appreciate the cutomers we have met and some who have become friends to Rick and I . Our children have all grown up at the market and it has been fun to watch our customer 's children grow up too. We hope that the support of local farming and a local staple such as the Northampton Farmer's Market will continue for many more years . See you there .........
