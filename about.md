## What We Grow
We mostly grow produce and cut flowers, but we also tend a flock of sheep and sell eggs from a flock of laying hens. The hens are all free roaming and fed locally produced grain.

Here are some ideas of what you can find by season:

### Spring
Plants for your gardens! Vegetables: onions, leeks, kale, swiss chard, spinach and beets. Flowers: pansies, geraniums, impatiens, and petunias. As well as herbs for your culinary pleasures!

### Summer
Lots of produce, including peas, beans, tomatoes, eggplant, and peppers.

### Fall
Winter squash, potatoes and sugar pumpkins.

## History of Intervale Farm
<img class="right-image" src="img/picking-up-hay.jpg">

Intervale Farm has been part of the Tracy Family since 1936 when it was purchased by Rick's grandfather, Dick Tracy.

It consists of 240 acres of fields, pastures and woodland. Janice and Bill, Rick's parents, ran the farm as a dairy until 1980.

Rick began growing vegetables in 1980 and continues this tradition today with his wife, Maureen, and his parents. We grow 12 acres of produce and cut flowers and raise plants in our three greenhouses. The plants and vegetables on the farm are grown without the use of chemical pesticides.

We began our CSA share program in 2002 and every year offer a variety of fruits, vegetables, and flowers for weekly pickup.

Our farm stand offers a place to pick up eggs, seasonal produce and flowers.
