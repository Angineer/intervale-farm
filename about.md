## What We Grow
<img class="right-image" src="img/market-table.png">
We mostly grow produce and cut flowers, but we also tend a flock of sheep and sell eggs from a flock of laying hens. The hens are all free roaming and fed locally produced grain.

Here are some ideas of what you can find by season:

### Spring
Plants for your gardens and herbs for your culinary pleasures!

Vegetables include onions, leeks, kale, swiss chard, spinach, and beets.

We have lots of options for your flower garden, including pansies, geraniums, impatiens, and petunias. We also have cut flower varieties including lisianthus, snapdragons, and zinnias.

### Summer
Summer brings lots of produce, including peas, beans, tomatoes, eggplant, peppers, and sweet corn.

It also brings beautiful cut flower bouquets. If you are interested in flowers for special events, check out the <a href="flowers">specialty flowers page</a>.

### Fall
As the season cools down, the vegetables continue with winter squash, potatoes and sugar pumpkins.

You can also decorate you house with mums and indian corn.

## History of Intervale Farm
<img class="right-image" src="img/picking-up-hay.jpg">
Today, the farm is run by Rick Tracy and Maureen Dempsey along with our nephew Ben Geary, but Intervale Farm has been part of the Tracy Family since 1936 when it was purchased by Rick's grandfather, Dick Tracy.

It consists of 240 acres of fields, pastures and woodland. Janice and Bill, Rick's parents, ran the farm as a dairy until 1980.

Rick and Maureen began growing vegetables in 1980 and we continue this tradition today. We grow 12 acres of produce and cut flowers, and raise plants in our 3 greenhouses. The plants and vegetables on the farm are grown without the use of chemical pesticides.

We began our CSA share program in 2002 and every year offer a variety of fruits, vegetables, and flowers for weekly pickup.
